## 1. Overview

### What is AgentGraph?
**AgentGraph** is a lightweight, production-grade autonomous agent graph orchestration reference implementation and runtime system. Evolved from an early in-house imperative runtime loop (`while not finished:`), the system undergoes a complete architectural paradigm shift to **Pregel superstep scheduling**, **declarative state reducers**, and **immutable spatiotemporal checkpointing** powered by LangGraph.

### Why does it exist?
Traditional autonomous agents typically rely on an imperative loop to drive agent reasoning and action. In production environments, this imperative design faces several fundamental architectural bottlenecks:
1. **Spaghetti Control Flow**: Branching, dynamic retries, error fallbacks, and multi-turn loops rapidly devolve into deeply nested, fragile `if-else` blocks.
2. **Shared Mutable State**: In-place mutation of shared context dictionaries leads to race conditions and dirty writes during asynchronous or parallel execution.
3. **Blocking Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Synchronous `input()` or thread-blocking polling monopolizes compute resources; server restarts or container migrations drop pending human approval requests permanently.
4. **Absence of Spatiotemporal Snapshots**: Flat chat histories preserve only conversational text, losing step-by-step intermediate variables, reasoning thoughts, and time-travel debugging capabilities.

AgentGraph resolves these challenges by adhering to a strict design philosophy: **State-centricity, Atomic Pure Nodes, Decoupled Topology, and Stateless Suspension**.

---

## 2. Implemented Features

> **Note**: In strict accordance with engineering discipline, only fully implemented and test-verified capabilities (56 unit and integration tests passing) are listed below. For upcoming features, see [Roadmap](#10-roadmap).

- **Declarative StateGraph Orchestration**: Strongly typed state schemas based on `TypedDict` and functional reducers (`add_messages`, `append_reducer`, `merge_dict_reducer`) that guarantee atomic incremental delta merging.
- **Pure-Function Stateless Nodes**: Planner node (`planner`), tool execution node (`tool_executor`), and human approval node (`human_approval`) wrapped in `with_error_boundary` exception barriers.
- **Adaptive ReAct Closed-Loop Routing**: Declarative conditional edges supporting dynamic tool-call loops, direct answers, and recursion limit fuses to prevent infinite loops.
- **Stateless Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Leverages native LangGraph 0.2 `interrupt()` to suspend execution upon encountering sensitive tools (e.g., file deletion, shell execution). The execution context is frozen to SQLite, and can be resumed or rejected via external `Command(resume=...)` without holding open threads.
- **SQLite Checkpoint & Time Travel**: Automatic state persistence at each superstep boundary, providing tenant session isolation via `thread_id` and parallel branch forking from historical checkpoints.
- **Production Terminal CLI**:
  - `jarvis chat`: Interactive multi-turn REPL with streaming-like Rich status cards.
  - `jarvis run`: Single-task execution with `--quiet` mode and `--yes` non-interactive auto-approval.
  - `jarvis sessions`: Inspect historical checkpoint snapshots stored in SQLite.
- **Dual-Model LLM Adapter**:
  - **Zero-Key Offline Demo Model**: Built-in deterministic `DemoModel` for instant evaluation of ReAct reasoning, tool calls, and HITL approval without network access or API keys.
  - **Universal OpenAI-Compatible Client**: Asynchronous `httpx`-based client compatible with DeepSeek, OpenAI, Ollama, and vLLM.

## 3. Architecture

AgentGraph enforces a layered, decoupled architecture with strict responsibility boundaries:

    subgraph Engine["AgentGraph Core Engine"]
        App <--> Router{Conditional Edge Router}
        Router <--> Planner[Planner Node]
        Router <--> Tool[Tool Executor Node]
        Router <--> Approval[Human Approval Node]
    end

    subgraph StateManagement["State & Persistence Foundation"]
        Engine <--> State[(AgentState: Messages / Scratchpad / Reducers)]
        Engine <--> Checkpointer[(SqliteSaver: Checkpoint Snapshots)]
    end

    Tool --> ExtTools[Local Safe Tools / Sensitive Tool Registry]

```

    end

## 4. Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition & Responsibility in AgentGraph |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AgentState** | The Single Source of Truth for the entire graph. Strongly typed, serving as the sole communication medium between nodes. |
| **Reducer** | Functional merger for state fields (e.g., `add_messages` for idempotent message upsert/deletion, `append_reducer` for cumulative thoughts). |
| **Node** | Pure callable calculation unit. Accepts an immutable state snapshot and yields a partial delta dictionary (`dict[str, Any]`), with no side effects. |
| **Edge / Router** | Static edges dictate deterministic transitions; conditional edges inspect state dynamically to determine next destinations. |
| **Interrupt** | Stateless execution suspension. On sensitive operations, the graph commits state to disk and yields control, awakened via `Command`. |
| **Checkpoint** | Superstep-level system snapshot. Stored in SQLite as a DAG version tree, enabling session isolation and time-travel debugging. |

## 6. Getting Started

### 6.1 Prerequisites
- **Python**: `>= 3.12` (Tested on Python 3.12 and Python 3.14)
- **Package Manager**: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Recommended for deterministic, fast environments)

### 6.2 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PublicYang/AgentGraph.git
cd AgentGraph

# Sync dependencies using uv
uv sync
```

### 6.3 30-Second Quick Start (Zero-Key Offline Demo Mode)

Explore full autonomous agent capabilities without requiring external network connectivity or API keys:

```bash
# 1. Start interactive multi-turn REPL chat
uv run jarvis chat --demo

# 2. Run single task: mathematical tool calculation
uv run jarvis run "Please calculate 25 * 40 + 150" --demo

# 3. Test Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) sensitive action interception
uv run jarvis run "Delete app.log" --demo

# 4. View historical session snapshots saved in SQLite
uv run jarvis sessions
```

> **Note**: The CLI binary entrypoint registered in `pyproject.toml` is `jarvis`. You may also run commands directly via `python -m cli.app <command>`.

### 6.4 Connecting Real LLM Endpoints

AgentGraph supports any provider compatible with the OpenAI API format (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc.):

```bash
# Configure environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="deepseek-chat"

# Launch session connected to real model
uv run jarvis chat
```

### 6.5 Running Test Suite
```bash
uv run pytest
```
*All 56 unit and integration test cases pass in under two seconds.*

---

## 7. Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | None | API authentication key for remote LLM providers (not required in `--demo` mode). |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g., DeepSeek, or local Ollama `http://localhost:11434/v1`). |
| `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` | `gpt-4o` | Target model identifier (e.g., `deepseek-chat`, `gpt-4o`, `qwen2.5:7b`). |

Checkpoints are persisted by default to `.jarvis_checkpoints.db` in the working directory (configurable via the `--db` option).

---

## 8. Development & Quality Gates

AgentGraph enforces strict code quality and pre-merge validation gates:

```bash
# Run one-click comprehensive quality gate (Lint + Format + Mypy + Pytest)
uv run python scripts/check.py

# Run individual quality checks
uv run ruff check .          # Lint check
uv run ruff format --check . # Code formatting check
uv run mypy .                # Strict type checking
uv run pytest -v             # Full unit and integration tests
```
